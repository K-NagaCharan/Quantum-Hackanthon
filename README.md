# 🧠 Quantum State Visualizer

An interactive tool for visualizing quantum states using Bloch spheres, density matrices, and entanglement metrics. Designed for researchers, students, and developers exploring quantum computing fundamentals.

## 🚀 Features

- **Bloch Sphere Explorer**  
  Rotate, zoom, and animate single-qubit states with intuitive gestures and real-time updates.

- **Density Matrix Viewer**  
  Visualize matrix elements with color-coded magnitude and phase. Supports mixed states and partial trace operations.

- **Entanglement Insights**  
  Display bipartite states with Schmidt decomposition, concurrence, and purity metrics.

- **Measurement Simulator**  
  Simulate projective measurements and visualize probabilistic collapse in different bases.

- **Circuit Integration (WIP)**  
  Input quantum circuits and track state evolution step-by-step.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + D3.js / Three.js  
- **Backend**: Python (Qiskit)  

## 🎯 Use Cases
